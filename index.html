                <p class="text-muted text-left">It’s a pleasure to welcome you to St. Xavier’s school.

                    St. Xavier’s School is known as one of the renowned schools in Bangalore. We are an academic institution that embraces the love of learning and has redefined academic excellence.

                    St. Xavier’s School (affiliated to CBSE) was founded by Mr. Collins Albuquerque and Mrs. Flavia Albuquerque in the year 2012.

                    As envisioned by the founders of our school, we are committed to provide an educational environment to our students and enable them to be diligent and ambitious. We believe in progressive learning and aim to exemplify a new dimension of education that does not encourage a routine practice. We rather prefer to elevate the divergent aspects of learning and prepare the young minds to be the best versions of themselves.

                    The school is proud of its outstanding results in the board examinations but is prouder of its students and the teachers who encourage them.

                    We aim to instill curiosity, confidence, compassion and love of learning in our pupils and thus help them empower everyone around them to prosper in the society. </p>

                <p class="text-muted text-left">An ideal vision is a bridge that makes dreams come true.

                    The founders of our school, Mr. Collins Albuquerque and Mrs. Flavia Albuquerque envisioned an academic institution where children from all strata of society would be able to unleash their potential.

                    To provide the young minds a progressive academic opportunity, they started building a chain of schools across the nation from 1997. They established schools not only in Karnataka but also in the state of Maharashtra. Their mission is to offer a one-of-a-kind pedagogic opportunity to the young generation by establishing more schools in the country.</p>

            </div>“We can do anything we want to do if we stick to it long enough.” These words of Helen Keller hold very true for us. We, at St. Xavier’s School aim at equipping our children with the strength to face all the challenges of life, with confidence and determination.

We believe that the children in today’s world are wandering in need of role models than of critics. Our motto ‘the dawn of a new era’ signifies the birth of that defining moment which radically transforms the present and embraces a challenging future.
